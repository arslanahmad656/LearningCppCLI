 Types
 ---------------------
	- Native values are not automatically boxed.
	- CLS types are automatically boxed when required.

	- When a value is boxed from stack, it is copied to the heap and the handle refers to the object on the heap. So the value is available even when the stack is destroyed.
	- When a pointer is created to a value on the stack and that pointer is returned by the function, this value will be destroyed on return.
